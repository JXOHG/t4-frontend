# Western Sales Club Website Codebase

This repository contains the frontend code for the Western Sales Club website built by **[Tech for Social Impact](https://uwotsi.com)** (TSI). 

The repository is called _t4-frontend_ because this website was built by the Winter 2025 Team 4 of TSI, and there were originally separate frontend and backend code repositories, but only the frontend code is in use now. 

## Updating the Website Content 

If you plan on updating content like **executive team**, **sponsors**, or **events**, navigate to the `wsc-vite-app/` folder. 

The ability to modify this data is provisioned by the Western Sales Club executive team.

## Structure

`wsc-vite-app/` Contains the main frontend application source code.
